# I donâ€™t store your data, period.

## Privacy Policy

Not only nothing ever leaves your device (app has no internet permission), I don't even store anything locally on you device (except config necessary to render widgets).

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

Although extremely unlikely, I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
