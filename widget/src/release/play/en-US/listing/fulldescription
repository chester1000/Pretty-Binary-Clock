I've been wandering through Play Store looking for a Binary Clock Widget that wasn't made by programmers with total contempt for design, and guess what? I couldn't find one, so I made one myself. 


<b>PROMO CODES:</b>
000) Only 16 available, so hurry up!
001) Share this Play Store page on fb, twitter, g+ or anything you like,
010) Shoot me an email (binary@meedamian.com) with a link to your share,
011) Optionally, suggest some new features or bugs you've experienced,
100) Get a PROMO CODE :).


<b>Features:</b>
 * Pretty,
 * Pure Binary and BCD,
 * 24-hours and AM/PM,
 * Customizable colors and sizes,
 * No wakelocks,
 * Clicking opens system clock.
 

If you have any suggestions, can create a better theme, or you've found a naughty bug just send me an @.
